# DotSlash6.0-ICWIM
DotSlash 6.0 Hackathon - ICWIM (Initiative to Convert Waste Into Money)
Problem Statement

# Project Description: 
This project is a part of Waste Management System(An initiative towards the clean and green India Movement). This initiative aids the country's advancement in the area of cleanliness and improves the hygienic and cleanliness of the country and the planet. By gathering, sorting, and submitting waste to the Waste Management Department, it also offers relief and reimbursement for user-paid house taxes. After that, the Waste Management agency will use the separated organic trash as fertilizer and possibly even make money from it. Moreover, organic waste can be recycled for use in the future.

# System WorkFlow:
1. The waste will be gathered and divided into organic and inorganic waste by the user.
2. After that, instead of just collecting the rubbish, the waste collection vehicle will weight the waste in kilogrammes and provide points to the user depending on that value.(This process is done within the website itself by the waste collecting officer simply by entering the propertyid of the user)
3. The website allows users to view the listed points (Keeps a track of points that were collected in the entire year)
4. At the end of the year based upon the points corresponding money will deducted from the house tax of the user.
5. The updated house tax is also available for download on the ICWIM Website.
